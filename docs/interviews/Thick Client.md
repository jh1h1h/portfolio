Thick client: desktop application or an application which does most of the processing client-side. This means the attacker can directly inspect most of the memory, files, and processes which it is running. This changes the main attack vectors compared to a typical web pentest.

The common attack vectors utilised against thick clients are Reverse Engineering, Local Data Tampering, Network Traffic Inspection and Manipulation as well as DLL Hijacking. This likely involves mastery over decompiling tools like Binary Ninja for static analysis, or gdb for dynamic analysis tools.
