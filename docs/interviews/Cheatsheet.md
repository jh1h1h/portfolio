Endpoint: devices like employee laptops and phones and sometimes servers. Network gear like switches and firewalls are not endpoints.

EDR: Endpoint Detection and Response

TCB (Trusted Computing Base): OS (kernel), hardware, firmware (BIOS/UEFI), and other security-critical software. If a component inside the TCB is compromised, the security of the entire system is jeopardized.
